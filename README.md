# Clean Code vs. Optimization: Debunking the False Dichotomy

This repository contains the full article and benchmark code for "Clean Code vs. Optimization: Debunking the False Dichotomy" - a comprehensive response to Casey Muratori's "Clean Code, Horrible Performance".

## Overview

This article challenges the false dichotomy between clean code and performance. Through rigorous benchmarking and analysis, it demonstrates that:

- Clean code and high performance are **not mutually exclusive**
- With proper optimization techniques, clean object-oriented code achieves **72x performance improvement** over baseline
- Modern branch prediction and SIMD optimizations enable the best of both worlds
- Strategic separation of concerns allows targeted optimization without sacrificing maintainability

## Key Results

| Approach | TotalArea (ms) | CornerArea (ms) | Speedup |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Clean Code (OOP) | 2.516 | 5.603 | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Switch-based | 0.644 | 0.643 | 3.9x / 8.7x |
| Table-driven | 0.639 | 0.655 | 3.9x / 8.6x |
| **Optimized Clean Code** | **0.035** | **0.075** | **72x / 75x** |

*Measured on AMD Ryzen 7 8745H with GCC 13.3.0*
